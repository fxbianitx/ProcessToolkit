ProcessTool is a centralized Business Rules Engine designed to evaluate deterministic rules via API and provide full audit traceability per request.
It enables organizations to externalize critical decision logic (discounts, validations, routing, tagging, blocking) from their ERP or internal systems into a clean, auditable, and maintainable service.
